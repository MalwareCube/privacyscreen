# PrivacyScreen
PrivacyScreen is a lightweight client-side browser extension used as a digital filter to hide sensitive form inputs, inactive tabs, and unfocused browser windows from prying eyes.

Whether you're entering sensitive data beside a stranger on an airplane or streaming your internet browsing online, PrivacyScreen can help secure the confidentially of the data on your browser.
